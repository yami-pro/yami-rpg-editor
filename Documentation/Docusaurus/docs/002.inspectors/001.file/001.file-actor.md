- Move Motion：The animation motion that plays automatically when the actor is moving, modified via the "Change Actor Motion" command

- Movement Speed：The initial movement speed of the actor, modified via the "Set Movement Speed" command
- Collision Size：Square side length for actor-to-actor collisions
- Collision Weight：Actor collision-related property, modified via the "Set Weight" command
  - When weight = 0, the actor's collision is ignored
  - When the weight of actor A : the weight of actor B = 1 : 1, the movement speed of A pushing B is 50%.
  - When the weight of actor A : the weight of actor B = 1 : 2, the movement speed of A pushing B is 0%.
  - When the weight of actor A : the weight of actor B = 2 : 1, the movement speed of A pushing B is 100%, there is no resistance at all.
  - You can set the weight of the NPC to the maximum value of 8, which cannot be pushed by others
- Scale：The scaling factor for the actor animation
- Priority：Prioritize actor animations when rendering, so that animations located below will always overlay those above.
  - Priority = -1 means that the sorting position is shifted up by one tile distance, and if the actor is a ground spike, the priority needs to be lowered
  - Priority = 1 means that the sorting position is shifted down by one tile distance, and if the actor is flying, the priority needs to be raised
