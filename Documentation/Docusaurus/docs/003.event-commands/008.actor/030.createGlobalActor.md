It is possible to take advantage of the fact that the data of a global actor is saved to design features such as  
Let the store owner share an global actor's inventory via the "Set Inventory" command. A random store inventory system could be implemented by adding some random equipments into this inventory every once in a while.  
Or have a global actor's inventory that acts as the player's store.

The initial party members will be automatically created as global actors during game initialization. (Check in the "Project Settings" Window)
