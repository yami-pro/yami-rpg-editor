If performing decimal operations, it is important to note that  
Because the possibilities of a decimal are infinite, and the finite memory capacity cannot hold infinite data, the decimals saved in the computer are approximations  
The following errors can occur  
0.3 - 0.1 = 0.1999999999999999998 instead of 0.2  
The above phenomenon may occur if there are multiple decimals involved in the operation  
You can correct the value by "Set Number command -> Math -> Round (keep decimal places)"
