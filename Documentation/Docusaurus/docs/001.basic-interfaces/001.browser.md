:::tip

In the file browser, you can change the name and path of a file as you like without causing an asset file path error. This is because: each file name contains a GUID (16 characters), but the GUID in the file name is hidden in the editor, and you can view the GUID in Explorer.

What happens if there are multiple files using the same GUID? 
Only one file will be shown in the editor, other files with duplicate GUIDs will be hidden. Will be implemented in a future update: remind the user which files have conflicting GUIDs.
